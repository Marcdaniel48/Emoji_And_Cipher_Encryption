Note: each page incorporates a JavaScript file that redirects first-time users based on whether they don't have an 'alreadyVisited' cookie attribute. This is intentional, because
this site will redirect first-time users to a tutorial-like page.
Google Chrome doesn't support local cookies, so the cookie will never be created, causing the user to always
be redirected.
This site cannot be properly accessed on Google Chrome, unless it's being run on an HTTP server or anything of the like.
'myJavaScriptFiles/setAlreadyVisitedCookies.js' is the file that's causing the redirects.
